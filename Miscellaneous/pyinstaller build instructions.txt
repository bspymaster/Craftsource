1) put craftbook.py, data.xml, and icon.ico (the application icon) in the pyinstaller folder
2)open command prompt and do the following commands (CASE SENSITIVE!):

    cd Desktop\pyinstaller

    python pyinstaller.py -mdata.xml -F -w -iicon.ico --hidden-import=xml.etree.ElementTree.parse --hidden-import=Tkinter --hidden-import=urllib.openurl -nCraftsource craftsource_stable.py

program is located in <pyinstaller\Craftsource\dist> folder. note that data.xml and icon.ico and readme MUST be added manually to the program in the same directory!

**add -d to the command for debug services**
