Craftsource
---------
An incredibly lightweight python program built to assist Minecraft users in remembering information like identification numbers and crafting formulas about in-game items and mobs.

Requirements
------------
>Windows XP/Vista/7/8
>Python 2.7 or above (If you have OS X or a Linux Distro)

How to use
----------
1)Install
  If you are on Windows, install Craftsource by running Craftsource.msi, otherwise just keep the raw files in the same folders.

2) Launch
  Open the program by double-clicking the executable (if you are on Windows), or by running the Unix shell script (If you are running OS X or Linux).

3) Usage
  Type in the object name or id of the object you wish to search for and press search. This program is not case sensitive. Search in the Crafting & Smelting tab will come up with results that are items, blocks, or mobs. Searching in the Brewing tab will search for potion results.
  Type in "mob: [mob/mob_id]" to locate a mob's info. Select "help" in the About menu to get in-program help. Select "about" in the About menu to get info on the program. Selecting "quit" in the File menu quits the program.
  Pressing "Find Next" repeatedly without changing your search query will shift you to the next option in the list that matches the query. Once the program gets to the end of the list, it loops back to the beginning.
  Pressing "Find Next" with an empty search bar will scroll through all the items availible in vanilla Minecraft. Searching "mod" will scroll you through a list of all the items installed in the program through mod packs.
  Selecting any of the options from the "Tutorials" menu will open a separate window with a helpful tutorial in it. You can also find general information about Minecraft by selecting an option in the "Game Info" menu.
